* have the chance to win cash prizes
* build your personal brand by writing
* learn about new and interesting APIs
* educate other developers with useful knowledge and best-practices
* contribute and give back to the developer community
* make a meaningful impact to open-source knowledge

Check out our full mission statement [here](http://tutorials.pluralsight.com/faq/).

## Why we are doing this

Our collective aim is working together to educate the world while improving our knowledge. Think of this as a "Wikipedia for technical guides and tutorials", or "Medium.com for developers" as another analogy

>We love Open-Source.  The tutorials on this site are open-sourced on Github, which we use daily and love.

We use Markdown (rather than WordPress), a simple file format. This is a simple text-based file format that takes around 60 seconds to understand. It's easy to make things bold, italics, code blocks, etc. Markdown is used in many places, such as Github README files.

Your technical guides are stored in Github as open-source, and you retain 100% ownership of your content.  With the Github API as a storage backend, hack.guides() tutorials can be forked, improved, and merged as easy as a pull request.  That way we can help each other create better, useful content.  Even this article is stored in Github, and you can help us edit and improve it :)


## Guidelines and suggestions for posts/topics

Feel free to write about any technology that you're passionate about. Generally speaking, one of the following:

- Tutorial on programming with X (where X is a technology or API you’re passionate about)
- Top 10 things you probably didn’t know about X
- Guide to what’s new in the latest version of X
- Advanced guide to programming with X
- Top 10 tips when programming with X

...or any other ideas you might have. 

Tutorials/articles ideally range from 1500-3000 words, including code blocks, to be a 'definitive guide' on a technical subject.  Here are a few examples of articles written in the past, that could serve as inspiration for you.

- [React vs. Angular2 when integrating with Rails](http://tutorials.pluralsight.com/ruby-ruby-on-rails/react-vs-angular-2-integration-with-rails)

- [Getting started with ECMAScript6](http://tutorials.pluralsight.com/front-end-javascript/getting-started-with-ecmascript6)

Note: If you're interested in qualifying for sponsor prizes, then you'll need to incorporate one of their APIs into your tutorial (this is similar to how sponsored hackathons work).  There are lots of creative ways to do this.  For example:

* You could write a tutorial on the API itself
* You could write a tutorial on a related useful topic, and use an API as a building-block to create your tutorial
* You could write a tutorial on building a sample application on a framework or programming language, and use the API as part of that sample application

## Contest Rules

Tutorials submitted between June 8th - July 30th will qualify for a chance to win prizes.  Winners will be announced on August 15th, 2016 based on following reviewing criteria:

* 1/3 of your score is based on the number of hearts (or "likes") that your articles receive on this site from your peers
* 1/3 of your score is based on the number of legitimate social shares (Facebook/Twitter/etc) of your articles
* 1/3 of your score is determined by a panel of our API judges, who gauge your writing style, communication ability, effective use of their technologies/APIs, and overall quality

The hack.guides() team will be solely administering the contest and prize distribution of the $500 prizes.  No payment nor purchase is required to participate.  Eligilibility of prizes is open to all participants who use a sponsored API in their tutorials.  In the highly unlikely case of a tied numerical score for two articles on the same API, the winner will be determined by an API judge panel vote.
