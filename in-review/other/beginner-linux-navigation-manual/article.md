Comprehensive Bash tutorial for the absolute Linux beginner
--------------------------------------------------------------
Welcome to the Linux world! Whether you’re just starting on an intro to CS course or wandering through your very first UNIX-based home server, learning how to navigate around in Linux (more specifically, using the command line) is going to make your life much easier and much much more powerful.

If you’ve been Googling around, you noticed that not a lot of written Linux tutorials out there are very beginner-friendly. In fact, none of them are. Except, maybe, this guy:

[Ryan's Linux Tutorial](http://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/ "Linux Tutorial")

First of all, his tutorials are excellent. His explanations are extensive and filled with tons of tips and tricks along the way. He also covered many solid aspects of working in the command line — very helpful for those who want to understand how the command line works. 

But what about this tutorial? It aims to equip you with the same, or perhaps, more compact explanations of some of the basic commands you should know when working in Linux. In short, this tutorial is a beginner-friendly guide to get you up and running as quickly as possible. Each explanation here will be succinct and empirical. So don’t expect me to cover more ground than Ryan’s tutorial. If you’d like to know more, simply refer to his tutorial. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me.

## Getting Started

### Linux

There are many distributions of Linux out there. Each of them has its own variation of commands to work with. Specifically for this tutorial, I’m going to be using **Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS** on **[Cloud9](www.c9.io)**. Keep in mind that all commands demonstrated here will probably be usable on earlier and future versions of Ubuntu, as well as Debian and Debian-based *distro*s.

To check for the distribution and version number, simply type this into the terminal.

    cat /etc/issue


### Bash

Not only do different distros have different commands, they also have different default *shell* (scripting environment). What this means is that this window — often called the *terminal* — works differently.

![Terminal window](https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/1200/1*I3GgyZBTMMcKMfgrLzfqXg.jpeg "Terminal window")

In this case, I’m going to be using **Bash** (short for Bourne-Again Shell), which is the default shell for Ubuntu and Debian.


### Structure

In Bash, you’ll typically be presented with this kind of prompt:

![Bash prompt](https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/1200/1*UEogQIjdTRZZbePT_4_l-w.jpeg "Bash prompt")

where `brillydev` is my username, and `~/workspace` is the directory I’m currently in, followed by a dollar sign (`$`), or depending on some user, a hash (`#`).

Because I’m lazy, I’m going to omit that `brillydev:~/workspace`, and leave only `$` when I show you my terminal window. You don’t need to type all of these `brillydev:~/workspace $` when you type the command.

Oh, and keep in mind that Linux is case-sensitive. `A` is different from `a`!



### Basic Navigation

#### pwd

`pwd` (print working directory) shows the current *directory* (basically, the folder) you’re in.

    $ pwd
    /home/brillydev/workspace

In case you’re wondering:

* `~` (tilde) means the user’s home directory, usually /home/username
* `.` (dot) means the current directory you’re in
* `..` (dot dot) means the parent directory of the current directory you’re in. 

   For example, if you’re in `foo/bar/`, `.` will represent `bar/`, `..` will represent `foo/
`.


#### cd

The most basic command of all time, `cd` (change directory) means ... Err, change directory.

    $ pwd
    /home/brillydev/workspace/foo/bar

    $ cd ..
    $ pwd
    /home/brillydev/workspace/foo

You can see that the directory changes according to what you type after `cd`. Typing `cd` alone without any *argument* (without anything that follows it) will bring you to the home directory of the user.

`cd` followed by a dash (`-`)will bring you to the recent directory you were in.

    $ cd
    $ pwd
    /home/brillydev

    $ cd workspace/foo
    $ pwd
    /home/brillydev/workspace/foo

    $ cd -
    $ pwd
    /home/brillydev


#### ls

`ls` (list) list down all the content inside the directory.

    $ pwd
    /home/brillydev/workspace
    
    $ ls
    apple.txt bar/ foo/ somefiles.txt

A slash (`/`) post-fixed after a name indicates that it is a directory. In this case, `bar` and `foo` are directories. Anything not with a slash are all files.


#### Flags

In addition to performing a general task, a command may also contain flags to specify a specific task you want the command to do. A flag is anything prefixed with a dash (`-`) that follows the command name.

For example, you can type `ls -l`. In this case, `l` being the flag, to display the content of the directory in a nice list view.

    $ ls -l
    total 8
    -rw-r--r-- 1 brillydev brillydev 0 Oct 22 13:18 apple.txt
    drwxr-xr-x 2 brillydev brillydev 4096 Jan 31 03:55 bar/
    drwxr-xr-x 2 brillydev brillydev 4096 Oct 22 13:18 foo/
    -rw-r--r-- 1 brillydev brillydev 0 Feb 6 14:08 somefiles.txt

Flags can also be combined. `ls -a` display all content, including hidden files (files that are prefixed with a dot). When used with `ls -l`, we can combine them like this:

    $ ls -la
    total 16
    drwxr-xr-x 4 brillydev brillydev 4096 Feb 21 08:04 ./
    drwxr-xr-x 10 brillydev brillydev 4096 Feb 21 07:55 ../
    -rw-r--r-- 1 brillydev brillydev 0 Oct 22 13:18 .hiddenfile.txt
    -rw-r--r-- 1 brillydev brillydev 0 Oct 22 13:18 apple.txt
    drwxr-xr-x 2 brillydev brillydev 4096 Jan 31 03:55 bar/
    drwxr-xr-x 2 brillydev brillydev 4096 Oct 22 13:18 foo/
    -rw-r--r-- 1 brillydev brillydev 0 Feb 6 14:08 somefiles.txt

Some flags can also be more than one-letter long. Those that are multiple letters long can be written with double dashes in front. For instance, `ls -a` can also be written as:

    $ ls --all
    ./ ../ .hiddenfile.txt apple.txt bar/ foo/ somefiles.txt


#### tree

For those who want more fancy visualization, `tree` is for you.

    $ tree 
    .
    ├── apple.txt
    ├── bar
    ├── foo
    └── somefiles.txt
    2 directories, 2 files


#### clear / reset / Ctrl + L / ⌘ + K

You’re having fun playing around with all these commands when you realize you screen is really cluttered and you need some clean up. Typing `clear` or `reset` or input any of the key combinations mentioned will get your terminal wiped up.


#### File Execution

Surprisingly not many beginners know how to run a standalone binary/executable file. To execute a local file, simply type

    $ ./filename 

If you ever find yourself stuck in the program, simply press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> to get out.


#### Some Addition
 
If shutting down the system is frustrating to you, here is the way to do it.

    $ shutdown -h now

To restart the computer:

    $ reboot

To log out:

    $ exit

or simply press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>D</kbd>.

If any of these don’t work, adding a `sudo` in front will probably help.

    $ sudo reboot



### File Manipulation

#### mkdir
`mkdir` (make directory) is used to create a directory.

    $ ls
    apple.txt foo/ somefiles.txt

    $ mkdir bar
    $ ls
    apple.txt bar/ foo/ somefiles.txt


#### mv
To move files, the command `mv` (move) is used.

    $ ls
    apple.txt bar/ foo/ somefiles.txt
    
    $ mv apple.txt foo

    $ ls
    bar/ foo/ somefiles.txt

    $ ls foo
    apple.txt

Interestingly, it can also be used to rename things as well!

    $ cd foo
    $ ls
    apple.txt

    $ mv apple.txt hello.txt
    $ ls
    hello.txt

And if you’re tired of typing `ls` every time after the command, a semicolon can condense your code into one line. This produces the same effect:

    $ mv apple.txt hello.txt; ls
    hello.txt


#### rm

`rm` (remove) removes files. Take note that this action cannot be undone.

    $ cd ..
    $ ls
    bar/ foo/ somefiles.txt

    $ rm somefiles.txt
    rm: remove regular file ‘somefiles.txt’? (y/n) y

    $ ls
    bar/ foo/

`rm` cannot be used with directories, unless accompanied by `-r` flag (short for *recursive*). What this means is that `rm` will go into every directory in the specified path and delete files one by one, recursively up each directory inside. If you don’t understand this, it’s fine, unless you do programming. Just remember that it deletes all the files and directories in the specified path.

    $ ls
    bar/ foo/

    $ rm -r foo
    rm: remove regular file ‘apple.txt’? (y/n) y
    rm: remove ‘foo’? (y/n) y

    $ ls
    bar/

If you’re tired of typing `y`s for all the files, `rm -rf` can help you. Be extremely careful, however, as this command-flag combination is incredibly dangerous. If you accidentally type the wrong path — boy, there’s no going back!


#### rmdir

If you try to use `rm` alone for directories, you’ll be faced with this:

    $ ls
    bar/

    $ rm bar
    rm: cannot remove ‘bar’: Is a directory

In this case, `rmdir` (remove directory) can be used instead. Note also that this command can only be used with empty directories.

    $ ls
    bar/

    $ rmdir bar
    $ ls
    $


#### touch

When you wish to create new (empty) files, use `touch`.

    $ ls
    $
    $ touch file1 file2.txt file3
    $ ls
    file1 file2.txt file3


#### cp

Copying is undeniably one of the greatest inventions of all time. To do that, use `cp` (copy).

    $ ls
    file1 file2.txt file3

    $ cp file2.txt file2copy.txt

    $ ls
    file1 file2.txt file2copy.txt file3

To copy a directory recursively, use `cp -r`.


#### ln -s

You’ll encounter this quite often in the future. So it’s probably good to know it now. To create a *symbolic link* (Google for explanations), use `ln -s`.

    $ ln -s ~/apache ~/Desktop/apache



### Working with Content

#### echo
`echo` prints out whatever you say to it.

    $ echo "hello world"
    hello world


#### cat / more / less / head / tail

To display the content of a file, use any of the commands above.

    $ cat hello.txt
    hello, world! I am a little puppy.
    Lorem ipsum blah blah blah.
    Three lines are enough for a sample, aren't they?
    
These commands don’t do exactly the same thing. Do some little experiments to find out how they differ :)


#### grep

`grep` is an extremely powerful tool to search the content of a file. It prints out the line containing the word(s) specified, if it is present in the file. For example.

    $ grep "blah blah blah" hello.txt
    Lorem ipsum blah blah blah.

(actual result will have `blah blah blah` highlighted)

There are a lot more powerful tools out there, such as `sed` and `awk`, that will unleash your potential in Linux. We can’t cover all of them here, so be sure to do some research to find out more about them!



### User Manual


#### man

If you happen to forget, or see a new command you’ve never heard of, apart from Google, your user manual will also be incredibly helpful. To use it, simply type `man`.

    $ man mkdir
    [LONG INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO USE mkdir]



### Piping and Redirection

#### Pipe

`|` (that vertical bar right above the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key) is called a *pipe*. It redirects the output of the left command to the input of the right. For example:

    $ echo “hello world\n
    You’re really cute.” | grep “cute”
    You’re really cute.


#### Redirection

Redirections are similar to pipe; but instead of passing the output as an input, they save the output to a file, or read the content of a file.

* `>` saves the output to a file
* `<` reads the content of a file


    $ ls foo > abc.txt 
    $ cat abc.txt
    bar/
    somefiles.txt

    $ wc < abc.txt
    21

Redirection overwrites the files each time it is used. Use appends (`>>` and `<<`) should you decide to not overwrite them, and append instead.
    
    $ ls foo >> abc.txt | grep "bar"
    bar/
    bar/



### Working with Packages

#### apt-get

Working with computers nowadays usually requires external software from the Internet. You can choose to download them manually, or use a package manager to manage all the stuff for you. `apt-get` (advance packaging tool) is the default package manager for Ubuntu and Debian.

    $ apt-get install vim
    $ apt-get remove vim
    $ apt-get update

If you ever get stuck, `sudo` can help you.


#### wget

`wget` is a tool to download files from the Internet.

    $ apt-get install wget
    $ wget https://www.google.com/thefilethatIwant.zip


#### tar / unzip

Sometimes you’ll get files in archived form. To extract them, use unzip or tar.

    $ apt-get install unzip
    $ apt-get install tar

    $ unzip thatfile.zip
    $ tar -xzvf anotherfile.tar.gz



### Text Editing

#### vi/vim

`vi` or `vim` (vi improved) is an awesome tool to do all things text. It’s incredibly difficult to use at first, but through time, you’ll realize that it’s one of the best out there.

    $ apt-get install vim
    $ vim sometext.txt

For instructions, I recommend this awesome interactive guide:

[Interactive Vim Tutorial](www.openvim.com)


#### nano

If you’re kinda lazy to learn `vim`, `nano` is a simple intuitive alternative.
    
    $ apt-get install nano
    $ nano sometext.txt


#### emacs

All-time rival of `vim`, here comes `emacs`.

    $ apt-get install emacs
    $ emacs sometext.txt



### Permissions

#### Overview

Remember this?

    $ ls -l
    total 8
    -rw-r--r-- 1 brillydev brillydev 0 Oct 22 13:18 apple.txt
    drwxr-xr-x 2 brillydev brillydev 4096 Jan 31 03:55 bar/
    drwxr-xr-x 2 brillydev brillydev 4096 Oct 22 13:18 foo/
    -rw-r--r-- 1 brillydev brillydev 0 Feb 6 14:08 somefiles.txt

Those arcane characters on the leftmost column are where your permission settings lie. To characterize, there are three main permissions you can set for a file or a directory: **read**, **write** and **execute**, represented by `r`, `w` and `x` respectively.

The permissions are arranged in the following order: **user**, **group** and **others**.

For example,

    -rw-r--r-- 1 brillydev brillydev 0 Oct 22 13:18 apple.txt

This means that the **user** (owner of `apple.txt`) can **read and write** to `apple.txt`, **the user group** which the owner of `apple.txt` is in, as well as **other people** from somewhere else can **only read** `apple.txt`.

**Execute**, in the context of a directory, also means **access**. Hence if you deny permission to execute a directory, you can’t access it.


#### chmod

To change permissions, `chmod` (change mode) can be used. I leave it to you to interpret what this means :P

    $ sudo chmod 777 apple.txt
    $ sudo chmod a-r apple.txt


#### chown

Similar to `chmod`, `chown` (change owner) changes the owner of the file.

    $ chown root apple.txt
